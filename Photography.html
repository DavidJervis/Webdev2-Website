<h1 id="h1"> Exposure and Field Trip: </h1>
<h2> Exposure </h2>


    <p id="paraone">Exposure is the amount of light per unit area reaching a photographic film or electronic image sensor, as determined by shutter speed, lens aperture and scene luminance. I had to experiment with shutter speed and depth of field and how lighting affects the photograph.My depth of field photo was based on plants in my back garden at the time with technique of concentrating on flowers with a blurry background. This is depth of field...
    <br><br>
    Shutter Speed is where you have 2 focus points in you're photo and they aim is to catch a moving object as clear as it's surroundings. Reverse phychology, your surroundings are then blurry giving emphasis on the moving object, in this case... My dog.</p>

    <p id="paratwo">The Final pieces of my exposure assignment where mostly of my chioce preferably. A photo of Street Photography and a photo of my choosing. For Street Photography, I took a picture of a concrete pavement with embed chalk art on the top side in the shape of a love heart with a possible tail ? couldn't be too sure.<br><br>
    The photo of my choosing was of a head statue positioned outside in my backgarden. I felt it's presence was unordinary as he most indefinitely stands out of the garden. It's cleanliness and purity of white gives it vivid finishing in a photo.</p>

<img id="photoimg3" src="images/photoimg3.jpg" alt="street">

   <p id="parathree">For the next assignment in Photography for me was a trip to multiple galleries in Dublin City Centre. First off I went to the <a href="https://www.nli.ie/en/homepage.aspx"> NPA</a>
   (National Photography Achieve) were 1000's upon 1000's of photos and art are kept underground in a vault and certain pieces are displayed every so often for a variety. We were given a task to choose and piece of interest and research about it. <br><br>

   I took interest in a full figure portrait of a Irish soldier shipping of too duty in World War 1 in a Irish Artillery Unit. His name is Edward Francis Frazer.</p>

<img id="photoimg5" src="images/photoimg5.jpg" alt="portrait">

   <p id="parafour">I then traveled to the <a href="http://www.galleryofphotography.ie/">Gallery Of Photography </a> across the square and explored all the exhibitions on each floor. Some pieces where striking to me as I do adore nature and everything evolved with beauty of our existence.</p>

<img id="photoimg6" src="images/photoimg6.jpg" alt="paint1">

<img id="photoimg7" src="images/photoimg7.jpg" alt="paint2">

   <p id="parafive">Once I saw all the exhibitions there, I was insturcted to travel to the <a href="http://www.imma.ie/en/index.htm">IMMA</a>(International Museum of Modern Art). Unfortunately on the day, half of the exhibitions were closed due to other projects being placed upon the walls at the time. There was some disturbing exhibits on display on the day focusing on animal brutality and the reality of their lifes as slaughter. The point was well put across for me anyways and didn't observe them for long. However there was 1 piece I took a photo off relating to previous about beauty of the world. This was actually taken in Ireland too which intrigued me by it's quality.</p>

<h1 id="h1_1">Photo Essay and Lab Work:</h1>

<p id="parasix">A photo essay consists of a series of photos that narative a story vividly through image. I chose the theme of Dublin City at it's finest and to capture it alive. This had to be given mucg thought as I could have picked anything to work with but chosen this direction instead. I had to use RAW files on my camera to get maxinmum usage of pre production editing.</p>

<img id="photoimg9" src="images/photoimg9.jpg" alt="essay1">

<img  id="photoimg10" src="images/photoimg10.jpg" alt="essay2">

<img id="photoimg11" src="images/photoimg11.jpg" alt="essay3">

   <p id="paraseven"> I had a muiltitude of labs for Photography including exposure and composition pieces upon others, I will list a few images below but it was mostly standard procedure to achieve knowledge about that technique.</p>

<img id="photoimg12" src="images/photoimg12.jpg" alt="lab1">

<img id="photoimg13" src="images/photoimg13.jpg" alt="lab2">

<p id="paraeight"> So far in Photography, I've had to take a 5 minute test of a setup of 3 lights to create a white background. I was quite confident in my ability to achieve this and done so well. We've experimented on other stuff like food photography also. I am on my last assignment which involves promotion with a food product of my choice.</p>
