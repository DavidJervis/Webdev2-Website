    <p id="paraone"> Design I think had alot of influence in this course so far, Multiple courses where based around design and I'll start with old faithful with Web Development part 1. With previous experience on coding, I blew through the simple tasks asked during the first few weeks with making just small webpages with basic information. We were given labs throughout every week or so. It consisted of 1-2 weeks depending on the difficulty. It was a good experience and I don't find wev dev hard just really time consuming. You do spend days creating websites but most of the time I know what I'm doing.</p>

    <p id="paratwo">My 1 and only assignment was to create a website of my choosing on a certain subject. I chose to create a website based on a television universe based off the DC Comics on CW Network known as the "Arrow Universe". It consists of 5 and now more tv shows in the same universe and every now and again they crossover due to circumstances. I watch all the tv shows and know very much about them therefore created a website about them. I do however have to remind myself this is my first ever website and things do get better. </p>

<p id="parathree"> During the same time, Visual Creativity was a module at the time, more practical than digital. I done various exercises involving emotions involved with drawing how much influence it can have on you. For the first few weeks I spent time around that exercising my weak hand too in drawing. Once then it moved onto visually capturing organic and mechanical objects making out the words organic/mechanic for a creativty exercise. There was interesting finishes for sure. I did what I could with what I had.</p>

<p id="parafour"> Towards the end of this year, The final Assignment was fun to do, I had to do a full A3 sheet poster for a combination of mechanical and organical objects. The theme I chose was animals and World War vehicles. With practice, I made some pretty crazy sketches and combinations for sure. Some I loved and liked, others not so much but it was just experimenting. unfortunately I didn't take any photos but most of it was practical anyways.</p>

<p id="parafive"> Into my second semester, Image manipulation and Design Practice and Process where 2 modules that fall under design category. I stumbled with Image manipulation at the start but eventually caught up. With image manipulation we mainly practiced exercises to gain knowledge about the tools I was using. Here are so examples... For the assignment however, I have to pick an interesting idea with all the knowledge gained to create a piece. My theme was to attempt to work with double exposure. Here are my concept boards to see what you think!</p>

<p id="parasix"> Design Process and Practice was the other module, Involved with mostly illustrations and drawings also. Similiar to Visual Creativty. My assignment was a poster but the idea/theme is "Advice for new students" in college. I was part of a group for this assignment and the process was big for this one. Over 5 weeks we had 4 stages to do.... Discover, Define, Deliver and final. The techniques taken in this assignment definitely widen my knowledge on how to approach dilemmas and situations.</p>
