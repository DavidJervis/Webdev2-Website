    <p id="paraone"> Introduction to Digital Media was my first Media module, The introduction was just the basis about the module and begin the first assignment 4 weeks in where I had to create a 2 minute video of still images to creating a story or montage. It was simple enough using Mac's software to edit the videos also. I enjoyed it coming from a different perpective cause I prefer Windows</p>

    <p id="paratwo">Between our first assignment and second assignment, I was assigned to do small audio assignments too where the first was to create a ringtone and second was an Q&A and both had to have had clean audio.</p>

   <p id="parathree">Assignment 2 was due in January, I had to create an original promotion video for a business or local community. I chose to do Phoenix Park and had a great adventure. I went to the park for a total of 3 days to try and get as much footage as I can and with my editing skills to provide a basis of knowledge about the park and whats in it and how I can display it to others. I really had fun and enjoyed this assignment very much so.</p>

   <p id="parafive">Moving on from Digital Media, They other forms of Media I am currently doing are Storytelling and Narrative. Surprisingly I have to do an animation for this module along with a story analysis of my choosing from a tv show or movie. I really enjoy this module so far and the story analysis was a blast. Both video formats so currently I'm beginning the animation therefore haven't got the finish product yet. However I will link my story analysis though.</p>
